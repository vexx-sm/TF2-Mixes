<h1 align="center">Team Fortress 2 Mixes</h1>



A SourceMod plugin that sets up a **6v6 competitive mix** where 2 captains pick players in an **XYXY** order. Includes random drafting, votes, and more.

> [!NOTE]
> A Discord bot is included to manage mixes in a TF2Center-style. It’s currently in the testing phase and requires version [0.3.2b](https://github.com/vexx-sm/TF2-Mixes/releases/tag/0.3.2b) or higher.

## How It Works

### 1. Setup Phase
- Players use `!captain` or `!cap` to become (or drop as) a captain.  
- Once two captains are selected **and at least 12 players are present**, all others are moved to spectator.
- Captains are randomly assigned to RED or BLU.  

### 2. Drafting Phase


- Captains pick players in order (XYXY XYXY XY).  
- Picked players are auto-moved to their captain's team.
- Each captain has **30s per turn**; if the timer expires, a random player is picked.  
- Captains may use `!remove` to drop a player (counts as a turn).  
- When both teams reach 6v6, a **10s countdown** begins before the game starts.  

### 3. Game Phase
- Players may change class, but **not teams**.  
- At the end of each round, players vote to either:  
  - Continue with same teams  
  - Start a new draft  
- Any vote requires **30% of players to initiate**, and passes with **⅔ majority**.  

> [!NOTE]
> Pre-game DM requires the provided [configs](https://github.com/vexx-sm/TF2-Mixes/releases/download/0.3.1/configs.zip), otherwise random spawns won't work.

## Installation 
1. Download the latest **SourceMod** version [here](https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php?branch=stable).
2. Download the latest **`mixes.smx`** from the [Releases](https://github.com/vexx-sm/TF2-Mixes/releases) page.
3. Place it in your `sourcemod/plugins` folder.
4. Reload the plugin or restart your server.
   
   **Optional:** 
     -	`mixes_dm.smx` provides DM features (health regen, random spawns). It's recommended for pre-game DM.
     -	Random spawns require these [configs](https://github.com/vexx-sm/TF2-Mixes/releases/download/0.3.1/configs.zip), extract in `tf2/tf/addons/sourcemod/configs`.

> [!WARNING]
> The plugin currently conflicts with SOAPdm, temporarily disable it for a proper experience.
