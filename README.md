<h1 align="center">Team Fortress 2 Mixes</h1>

A SourceMod plugin that sets up a 6v6 competitive mix where 2 captains can pick players in an XYXY XYXY XY fashion. Random drafting, votes and more.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The plugin is in an early stage and currently serves as a base. 12v12 and much more is planned.

## How It Works

1. **Setup Phase**:
   - 2 Players use `!captain` or `!cap` to become or drop themselves as team captains.
   - Once two captains are selected and a minimum of 12 players are present, All other players are moved to spectator with the 2 captains randomly assigned to red or blu

2. **Drafting Phase**:
   - Captains take turns picking players (XYXY XYXY XY pattern)
   - Picked players are automatically moved to their captain's team
   - Each captain has a 30 second timer to make their pick. If the timer expires, a random player is auto-picked and the turn passes to the other team
   - If a captain disconnects or drop their captain stat, a 30 second grace period starts for a replacement after which the game is canceled if no replacement is present

3. **Gameplay Phase**:
   - Teams are locked to prevent switching
   - Players can change classes but not teams
   - At the end of each round, a vote starts for:
     - Continue with same teams
     - Start new draft
     - End mix
   - 2/3 majority required for vote to pass
